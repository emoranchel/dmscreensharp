# Introduction #

The first thing you will notice while using the DMScreen is that it opens two windows thats because one is for you and the other is for your players, the big one with lots of buttons and options is the DMScreen, the other is the players view. This way is possible to show the action to your players while you keeps some secrets from them in another screen.

# Recomendations #

There are multiple ways of using this, some far more expensive than others. Here are some that I found useful.

If you have a laptop you are just a couple steps away. Get a monitor plug it in, extend your desktop and move the players view to the other screen, maximize it and you are set.

Other way is using a projector, some are kind of cheap, project on a wall and you are set.

Using a projector you can also project to a table, just put the projector in the ceiling facing down to a table, get a white surface on top and you will be amazed at the results.

Have a fancy HDTV? well, you can use it too, get a HDMI cable and a HDMI capable videocard and use it as another display.

Have only one computer with one monitor? well it can be certainly useful, you can still track everything on your pc, and on the pc turns, turn around the monitor and show them how it is progressing.

You can also have an old skool map and use this software just as an aid to track the action.
